# Stock-Prediction-Model-Using-LSTM-CNN
This Stock Prediction Model is highly advanced from its predecessors as it is using a hybrid approach of Long-Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks.

This hybrid Approach of LSTM and CNN makes the model highly accurate as well as efficient.
for the ease of use, also devleopd an application using the python and streamlit with which you can easily showcase the prowess of your project.

This one gotta long tech stack as it includes-
1. Python
   libraries of python which will be required are
   1. Numpy
   2. Pandas
   3. yFinance
   4. Matplotlib
   5. scipy
   6. keras
   7. tensorflow
   8. scikit learn
   9. streamlit

 in order to get a deeper understanding about the working of this project one should firstly go through libraries like-
 1 Keras 
 2 Tensorflow 
 3 Scikit learn
 4 Streamlit

 understanding the above libraries will further help in comprehension of how the hybrid approach of LSTM and CNN is applied and deployed on this project.
